PARADIS aims at analyzing digital surfaces. Our approach will consist in finding
digital plane segments onto digital surfaces \ref{goalppa} and deriving first-order
estimates such as normal direction \ref{goalestim}. Digital plane segments will
also provide a way of detecting meaningful scales automatically \ref{goalscale}.

Toward these goals, we propose four work packages (WP) summarized below and
developed within this section. The first two are devoted to the improvement of
plane-probing algorithms, which will be our main tool to achieve goals \ref{goalestim}
and \ref{goalscale} in the last two packages. 

\begin{enumerate} [label=(W\arabic*),start=0]
\item Plane-probing algorithms (first year). In this WP, we want to
  improve various features of plane-probing algorithms, even in the
  planar case. Due to preliminary works, we have in mind many short-term tasks for this.  \label{wp0}
\item Pattern generation (first two years). In this WP, we seek a way to associate
  to the state of a plane-probing algorithm a piece of digital plane
  that fits to the digital surface in order to correctly process non-planar parts,
  especially non-convex parts. This requires not only expertise in
  digital geometry but also in multidimensional continued fractions
  algorithms and combinatorics on words (see \sect{sec:dps} and below).  \label{wp1} 
\item Geometric inference and applications (year 2,3). This WP is devoted
  to the derivation of efficient, parameter-free, multigrid-convergent estimators.
  The goal of this WP is also to investigate at one application based on such
  estimators such as surface fairing or digital surface visualization. \label{wp2} 
\item Multiscale analysis of digital surface (year 3,4). In this WP, we
  seek a way to locally detect the best scales of analysis, based on properties
  of digital plane segments. \label{wp3}
\end{enumerate}

Since there are so many perspectives and paths to follow, this project needs
to strengthen a team of experts by full-time workers in order to make the best of them.
We request
\begin{itemize}
\item[(MS)] one master project funding to help us on short-term tasks in \ref{wp0},
\item[(PhD)] one PhD grant for working on \ref{wp2} and \ref{wp3},
\item[(Postdoc)] one postdoctoral student with background in digital geometry,
  combinatorics on words or both for working on \ref{wp1} during two years
  in order to strengthen the transdisciplinarity of the project. 
\end{itemize}


%% This \textbf{four-year project} will be divided into four work packages (WP).

\medskip

As explained in \sect{sec:dps}, a plane-probing algorithms sparsely probes the data points
around a starting point to compute a local normal direction. Several algorithms of this kind
has been proposed by the principal investigator and its collaborators
\cite{LPRTCS2016, LPRDGCI2016, LPRJMIV2017}.
What makes them original in regard to the state of the art, is that they decide on-the-fly
how to probe the digital surface, without any parameter or any prior order.

The last proposed algorithm, called \emph{R-algorithm} in \cite{LPRJMIV2017}, is the most
local algorithm. In order to explain what we mean by \emph{local}, we recall that
the R-algorithm iteratively deforms an initial tetrahedron. One vertex, denoted by $q$,
is however fixed and is always projected into the opposite triangular facet, denoted by
$F := (v_0,v_1,v_2)$. For any permutation $\sigma$ over $\{0,1,2\}$, $F$ defines a 2D
lattice embedded in 3D:
$\Lambda := \{ v_{\sigma(0)} + k (v_{\sigma(1)}-v_{\sigma(0)}) + k' (v_{\sigma(2)}-v_{\sigma(1)}) \ | \ k,k' \in \Z \}$. 
The basis $(v_{\sigma(1)}-v_{\sigma(0)}, v_{\sigma(2)}-v_{\sigma(1)})$ is \emph{reduced} if and only
if they are the two shortest nonzero vectors of $\Lambda$. By extension $F$ is said reduced
if there exists a permutation $\sigma$ such that $(v_{\sigma(1)}-v_{\sigma(0)}, v_{\sigma(2)}-v_{\sigma(1)})$
is reduced. The following conjucture is experimentally true but not yet proved:

\begin{Conjecture}
  \label{conj:reduction}
  The facet $F$ returned by the R-algorithm is reduced at least every two steps and
  is always reduced at the last step.  
\end{Conjecture}

A first task of this WP is to prove this conjecture, because it may be
a key ingredient to certify the locality of the R-algorithm and answer
the following questions: can we bound by above the distance of the probed
points to the starting point? 
what is the minimal part $\Part \subset \Plane{\mu}{\vec{n}}$ for which the
R-algorithm returns the normal $\vec{n}$ when applied to $\Part$?
can we characterize the behavior of the R-algorithm on a convex or arbitrary
part of a digital surface?

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:reduction}
  Prove conjecture~\ref{conj:reduction} and certify the locality of the R-algorithm. 
\end{Task}

Another task in this WP is related to the starting point. In \cite{LPRJMIV2017},
it must be a \emph{reentrant corner}. This restriction avoids degenerate cases, but
limit the pratical usage of the algorithm for digital surface analysis
(see fig.~\ref{fig:snow}). Raising this restriction to points whose neighboring
surfels form a flat part along one or two axis is however just a technical
problem that can be quickly solved. A more important challenge is that the R-algorithm
stops prematurately and outputs only an approximation of the normal vector for some
well-indentified starting points, which are not located deeply enough in the digital
surface. Even if we know how to detect and remove approximated results
\emph{a posteriori} \cite{LPRJMIV2017}, it would be quite interesting to translate
the starting point to deeper and deeper positions in order to avoid producing any
approximated results.
%TODO ne remet pas en cause la localite.
%Finally, it remains the \emph{sailent corners}. 
%how to retrieve complementary facets ?
%TODO: parler des facettes complementaires ?

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:start}
  Modify the R-algorithm so that it can be run from any starting point. 
\end{Task}

The master project will focus on this task. %~\ref{task:start}. 

\Risks
Preliminary works have considerably reduced the risks in this WP. Task~\ref{task:start}
can be done within one year. If we face to a difficulty that cannot be overcomed,
we will resort to the R-algorithm as it is described in \cite{LPRJMIV2017} and use it
to improve the approach of \citeauthor*{Charrier2011} \cite{Charrier2011}, as explained
in \ref{riskppa}. Task~\ref{task:reduction} is very important to rely on provable
properties but not completing it does not prevent us from developing practical algorithms.

\medskip

Plane-probing algorithms probe for data points in a sparse way.
This is perfect for digital plane recognition, but not for pieces
of digital plane on digital surfaces. Evolving tetrahedra may jump
over holes or cracks in the surface for instance. Therefore,
we have to associate a piece of digital plane
to the current facet and check whether it fits to the digital surface
or not.

Instead of digitizing the current facet, we choose to generate a piece
of digital plane closely related to the matrix sequence computed by
the plane-probing algorithms (see \sect{sec:dps}). We believe that
this approach will not only provide a hierarchy of pieces of digital
plane with controlled shape, but also a deep understanding of the
combinatorial structure of digital planes. If this combinatorial
structure is completely understood, it will be possible to implicitely
describe various pieces of digital plane by exchanging some well-identified
parts of it, which will lead to a more flexible algorithm. 

The challenge in this WP is to generate digital plane segments (DPSs)
having several properties \cite{Jamet2016}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(P\arabic*)]
\item they must be included in the tangent digital plane; \label{prop:inside}
\item at least two independent period vectors should be deduced from them
  so that the whole tangent digital plane is implicitly described by translation
  (and that is why such DPSs are called \emph{patterns}); \label{prop:period}
\item they should form a connected set; \label{prop:connect}
\item they should be as small as possible to avoid redundancy,
  \eg $n_i$ surfels of normal vector $\vec{e}_i$, where $n_i$ is the i-th coordinate
  of $\vec{n}$. \label{prop:small}
\end{enumerate}
We can add other properties about their shape: 
convexity, smallest possible elongation or maximal distance to the starting point.
%% It may also contain the standard digitization of the current facet returned by
%% a plane-probing algorithm. 

As reported in \sect{sec:dps}, there are two main generic methods for generating patterns
from an arbitrary multidimensional continued fractions (MCF) algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(M\arabic*)]
\item one is based on dual substitutions, \label{m:sub}
\item another one is based on a translation-union algorithm. \label{m:tu}
\end{enumerate}
We believe that these two approaches are closely related, but this requires
further investigation because they rely on different frameworks. 

\emph{Christoffel parallelograms}, introduced in \cite{Labbe2015},
encode a digitization of 3D planar parallelograms. They have strong
structural properties, similar to those of Christoffel words:
symmetry of their central part and conjugation with their reversal.
The concatenation of two Christoffel parallelograms into another one
is not yet understood, but this question is closely related to MCF
and pattern generation. 

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:genmeth}
  Study methods \ref{m:sub} and \ref{m:tu} on arbitrary MCF algorithms,
  compare them and relate them to Christoffel parallelograms.   
\end{Task}

Even if MCF algorithms usually guarantee some of the above properties
(at least \ref{prop:inside} and \ref{prop:period}),
they do not take into account the pattern shape. As any other MCF algorithm, the R-algorithm
also produces a sequence of matrices, denoted by $M_1..M_n$. We believe that the R-algorithm
is a good candidate for methods \ref{m:sub} and \ref{m:tu} in order to generate patterns with shape
constraints because it returns a reduced triangular facet.

One difficulty is that several substitutions can be associated to the same matrix
(but a substitution has one incidence matrix). First, we may consider all the possible
substitution sequences
$\Sigma := \{ \sigma_1..\sigma_n \ | \ \sigma_i \text{ is a possible substitution for } M_i \}$.

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:genexp}
  Experimentally check if the properties \ref{prop:inside}-\ref{prop:small}
  hold for patterns generated from $\Sigma$ by methods \ref{m:sub} and \ref{m:tu}.  
\end{Task}

Although it is hardly never investigated in the field of MCF algorithms, the choice of a
substitution can play an important role, especially for \ref{prop:connect} and \ref{prop:small}.
In our geometric setting, we can expect a criterion for choosing a convenient substitution at each step. 

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:genpat}
  Generate a pattern having at least properties \ref{prop:inside}-\ref{prop:small} in the course of
  the R-algorithm or another plane-probing algorithm (task~\ref{task:start}). 
\end{Task}

For this WP, we expect strong and rich interactions between digital geometry, combinatorics on words
and the field of MCF algorithms as highlighted by the collaborators' expertise. The postdoctoral
student will be involved in all these tasks and will carefully follow and integrate the advances
of \ref{wp0}.

\Risks
We do not know if it is possible to generate patterns with all the above properties
or an appropriate subset of them in order to correctly process non-convex parts,
in spite of promising results. Still, we have algorithmic solutions
\cite{LPRJMIV2017} to cope with these problems, which alleviate such risk. 
On the contrary, a success in this WP would lead to both theoretical results
on MCF algorithms and related geometric problems, and a speed-up in the analysis
of digital surfaces thanks to arithmetic and combinatorial properties.  

\Success

\medskip
\WP{2}{Geometric inference and applications (T+12-T+30)}
   {Propose a parameter-free, multigrid-convergent normal estimator \ref{goalestim}}
   {C. Coeurjolly, J-O. Lachaud, T. Roussillon, \textbf{PhD}}
   {Technical report at T+30.}
\medskip

 Most of the time, when we are working with a digital surface, we are 
interested in the geometry of a continuous shape whose digitization is the input digital data.
We expect that a given geometric quantity, such as a normal vector, computed at a point of a digital surface
is close to the one of the underlying continuous shape at a close enough point. 
This WP aims at providing efficient, parameter-free and multigrid-convergent estimators based of
the output of plane-probing algorithms: normal vector (and surfel area as a by-product),
distance to boundary, voxel coverage (fig.~\ref{fig:2D}).

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:normal}
  Propose a parameter-free normal estimator based on plane-probing algorithms and
  derive other first-order estimators.  
\end{Task}

The accuracy of a multigrid-convergent estimator depends on the resolution: the higher the resolution,
the more accurate the estimator. An important task in this WP is to experimentally and theoretically
study the estimation accuracy for shapes digitized at increasing resolutions. The theoretical study
will probably rely on the size of the facets returned by plane-probing algorithms: the bigger the facets,
the less sensitive to digitization noise the estimator. 

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:conv}
  Study the growth rate of the facets returned by plane-probing algorithms
  and the estimators accuracy for smooth shapes digitized at increasing resolutions. 
\end{Task}

Plane-probing algorithms not only provide a normal vector but also position information,
which may be useful for many applications in graphics such as polyhedral approximation,
surface fairing or digital surface visualization. The goal of this WP is also to investigate
at least one of these applications.   

We can approximate a digital surface either by a polyhedral surface whose vertices 
are a subset of the input data points, as in (relative) convex hulls 
\cite{Klette2001,Schultz2009} 
or by a quadrangular mesh whose vertices are set to optimized positions, so that it is
as smooth as possible. In the former problem, the facets returned by the
plane-probing algorithms will play an important role, while in the latter,
normal estimates are usually a key input of the optimization step (see for instance
\cite{Coeurjolly2017}).  

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:approx}
  Design an algorithm that computes a fair approximation of a digital surface. 
\end{Task}

Even if meshes can be efficiently visualized because of hardware support,
it may be interesting to directly render the input data. Ray casting can be used to
visualize digital surfaces. Results will be greatly improved by accurate normal estimates,
but also by accurate position estimates. In addition, voxel coverage and absorption can
also be used to remove staircase effects near shape borders in the resulting 2D view.

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:rendering}
  Design an algorithm that directly renders digital surfaces using first-order estimations.  
\end{Task}

The PhD student will work on all these tasks. This WP, and especially tasks~\ref{task:normal}
and \ref{task:conv}, will be the core of its thesis project. Tasks \ref{task:approx},
\ref{task:rendering} and \ref{wp3} will be applications of its main thesis topic.  

\Risks
The main risk in this WP is that normal estimators
directly derived from plane-probing algorithms do not have the multigrid-convergence
property. In that case, fall-back solutions presented in \ref{riskestim} will achieve
multigrid-convergence without any parameter but at the price of a higher computational
cost and a lower accuracy in the localization of sharp features. 

\Success
\begin{itemize}
  \item A parameter-free and multigrid-convergent normal estimator.
  \item At least one of the tasks~\ref{task:approx} and \ref{task:rendering} is completed. 
  \item Implementation of the estimator in \DGtal.
\end{itemize}

The first two items will have to be included in a technical report at T+30.
The last one will be part of a software release at T+48, which will include
the outcome of \ref{wp3}.

\medskip

Digital surfaces may be degraded with \emph{noise}, especially in medical imaging.
Since noise usually affect only the finest levels of details, the following algorithm
is a way of coping with the problem: while there is noise, subsample by 2 the digital surface.
At the end, we get a noise-free digital surface, but at a potentially coarser level.
In addition, in case of non-uniform noise, the same applies only locally, \ie at each border voxel.  

The challenge here is to detect noise. This can be done by computing the growth rate of the
\emph{number} or \emph{size} of the computed facets for decreasing resolutions
%(see fig.~\ref{fig:snow} for an example of one such facet)
and by comparing it with the theoretical or experimental law for digitization of smooth shapes.
A significative difference between the two rates suggest that there is noise.
%TODO dire que dans cette partie, il y a des paramètres mais peu sensibles ?
This strategy has been used with success for digital curves \cite{Kerautret2012}
and the goal of this WP is to provide the theoretical results and tools required to apply it on digital surfaces. 

TODO illustration 2D ?

First, we will focus on the number of facets returned by plane-probing algorithms.
This global strategy, which provides a way of retrieving the scale with highest resolution
where noise is unlikely, is enough in case of uniform noise. 

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:global}
  Develop a tool that automatically returns the first noise-free subsample of an input 3D volume.
\end{Task}

Then, we will locally focus on the size of all facets covering a same data point for various resolutions. 
This local strategy is better than the previous one in case of non-uniform noise but provides however
a more complex output because the best scale is computed at each data point.
We can either simply output this information to feed high-level tools or compute estimates during
the scale detection, such as a normal estimator robust to noise.  

\begin{Task}
  \label{task:local}
  Develop a tool that automatically adds to a digital surface a scale value and
  a robust-to-noise normal estimate at each data point. 
\end{Task}
%alpha-shape, ball unions

\Risks
We are confident on the feasibility of the global strategy (task~\ref{task:global}),
because computed facets are closely related to convex hull facets in convex parts
and the growth rate of the number of convex hull facets is known for digitization
of convex smooth shapes \cite{Barany1998}. 
Task~\ref{task:local} could be however more difficult to complete
because it depends on a sound definition of the size of a facet (task~\ref{task:conv})
for which the growth rate is clearly different for smooth parts on one hand
and noise or small-scale features on the other hand. If it is not the case, we can
resort to the length of the maximal DSSs along 2D slices as explained in \ref{riskscale}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:tasks} shows the dependency graph of all the project tasks, which
are gathered in the center of the picture. They are row-aligned by WP,
\ie all the tasks of a same line belong to the same WP. 
The solid arrows represent the dependency of a task toward another,
\eg task~\ref{task:genpat} depends on task~\ref{task:start}. 
The dashed arrows are used to connect the main tasks to their fall-back solutions,
described in \sect{sec:methodo}.

  \input{tasks.tikz}
  \caption{Dependency graph of the project tasks. See \sect{sec:schedule} for details.}
  \label{fig:tasks}
\end{figure}

We clearly see in fig.~\ref{fig:tasks} that \ref{wp0} and \ref{wp1} can be started
at the beginning of the project, whereas \ref{wp2} and \ref{wp3}, which greatly depend
on tasks~\ref{task:start} and \ref{task:genpat}, respectively in \ref{wp0} and \ref{wp1}
must be delayed. \ref{wp3} will start after \ref{wp0} and \ref{wp1}, but \ref{wp2} will
start earlier, because we will first focus on convex parts and only task~\ref{task:start}
in \ref{wp0} is required for that.

To sum up, fig.~\ref{fig:gantt} shows the Gantt chart of the project schedule.
The WPs are listed on the vertical axis and time intervals on the horizontal axis.
The width of the horizontal dark blue bars show the duration of each WP. The first WP,
which mainly consists of short-term tasks is one-year long whereas the next ones are
two-year long. Deliverables are located at the finish date of each WP. They will be
provided in the form of technical reports at T+12 and T+30, and in the form of software
release at T+24 and T+48.

The postdoctoral student will be hired for working on \ref{wp1} at the beginning of the project.

\textbf{Staff ($\approx$ 205k \euro).} As described in the scientific program (\sect{sec:wp} and \sect{sec:schedule}),
we request one PhD grant and one master project funding ($\approx$ 111k \euro).
A same student would basically start working on \ref{wp0} during its master project and then
continue with \ref{wp2} and \ref{wp3} during its PhD thesis.
We also need a postdoctoral student for working on \ref{wp1} during two years ($\approx$ 95k \euro). 
The transdisciplinarity, difficulty and importance of \ref{wp1} requires an experienced student
that already has good technical abilities and an expert knowledge of at least digital geometry
or combinatorics on words. This position will let him gain new skills in a cutting-edge project
and launch its career. On the project side, this full-time worker will strengthen the synergy and
convergence of the team skills. 

\textbf{Travel costs ($\approx$ 30k \euro).}
We also request funds for one international travel (2,000 \euro~on average)
per year for the PI (4 years), the PhD student (3 years) and the postdoctoral student (2 years)
but only one during the whole project for the four other collaborators due to their lower involvement.
We estimate this cost at 2,000 x (4 years-PI + 3 years-PhD + 2 years-Postdoc + 4 collaborators) = 26,000 \euro. 

In addition, we would like to promote frequent face-to-face interactions between the team members.
We plan work meetings twice a year during two years with
S. Labb\'{e} \ref{wp0}\ref{wp1} (LABRI, Bordeaux) and
with B. Kerautret \ref{wp3} (LORIA, Nancy),
but during four years
with J-O. Lachaud \ref{wp0}\ref{wp2}\ref{wp3} (LAMA, Chamb\'{e}ry).
We estimate the cost of a work meeting at 275 \euro~per person
for Lyon-Bordeaux and for Lyon-Nancy,
but only 60 \euro~for Lyon-Chamb\'{e}ry.
With three travelers on average per work meeting, we estimate the total cost at:

\begin{tabular}{lrr}
  (Lyon-Bordeaux) & 275 x 2 years x 3 travelers on average =& 1,650 \euro~\\ 
  (Lyon-Nancy) & 275 x 2 years x 3 travelers on average =& 1,650 \euro~\\
  (Lyon-Chamb\'{e}ry) & 60 x 4 years x 3 travelers on average =& 720 \euro~\\
  Total & ~ & 4,200 \euro~\\
\end{tabular}
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item [~]  = 1,650 \euro~ 
%%   \item [$+$] 275 x 2 years x 3 travelers on average = 1,650 \euro
%%   \item [$+$] 60 x 4 years x 3 travelers on average = 720 \euro
%%   \item [$=$] 4,200 \euro. 
%% \end{itemize}

\textbf{Material costs ($\approx$ 6k \euro).}
We request four standard computers (1500 \euro) for the PI and each student to work on.
We estimate this cost at 1,500 \euro~x 4 = 6000 \euro.
