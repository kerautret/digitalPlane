abstract="Techniques to estimate the surface area of regular solids based on polyhedrization are classified to be either local or global. Surface area calculated by local techniques generally fails to be multigrid convergent. One of the global techniques which is based on calculating the convex hull shows a tendency to be multigrid convergent. However this algorithm only deals with convex sets. The paper estimates the surface area using another global technique called DPS (Digital Planar Segment) algorithm. The projection of these DPSes into Euclidean planes is used to estimate the surface area. Multigrid convergence experiments of the estimated surface area value are used to evaluate the performance of this new method for surface area measurement.",

We briefly describe an implementation of the algorithm and show example outputs. ",

abstract="We introduce a new discrete primitive, the blurred piece of a discrete plane, which relies on the arithmetic definition of discrete planes. It generalizes such planes, admitting that some points are missing and then permits to adapt to noisy discrete data. Two recognition algorithms of such primitives are proposed: the first one is a geometrical algorithm and minimizes the Euclidean distance and the second one relies on linear programming and minimizes the vertical distance.",

abstract="This paper introduces a method for the digital naive plane recognition problem. This method is a revision of a previous one. It is the only method which guarantees an O(nlogD) time complexity in the worst-case, where (D{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}1) represents the size of a bounding box that encloses the points, and which is very efficient in practice. The presented approach consists in determining if a set of n points in ℤ3 corresponds to a piece of digital naive hyperplane in                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}lfloor 4{\backslash}log{\_}{\{}9/5{\}}D {\backslash}rfloor + 10{\$}                 iterations in the worst case. Each iteration performs n dot products. The method determines whether a set of 106 voxels corresponds to a piece of a digital plane in ten iterations in the average which is five times less than the upper bound. In addition, the approach succeeds in reducing the digital naive plane recognition problem in ℤ3 to a feasibility problem on a two-dimensional convex function. This method is especially fitted when the set of points is dense in the bounding box, i.e. when                                                                           {\$}D=O({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}){\$}                .",

However, uses, in some cases called strongly exterior cases, some validity criteria which are only sufficient but not necessary. In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions (including strongly exterior cases) to recognize pieces of digital planes. We build up a simplified form of Debled's algorithm. Furthermore, our approach is independent from the rectangular form of pieces considered by Debled.",

abstract = {Dual maps have been introduced as a generalization to higher dimensions of word substitutions and free group morphisms. In this paper, we study the action of these dual maps on particular discrete planes and surfaces, namely stepped planes and stepped surfaces. We show that dual maps can be seen as discretizations of toral automorphisms. We then provide a connection between stepped planes and the Brun multi-dimensional continued fraction algorithm, based on a desubstitution process defined on local geometric configurations of stepped planes. By extending this connection to stepped surfaces, we obtain an effective characterization of stepped planes (more exactly, stepped quasi-planes) among stepped surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.
